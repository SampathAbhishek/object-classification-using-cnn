Objects can be easily detected and identified by humans. The visual
system of human is very fast and accurate and can perform complex tasks like
object identification and detection very easily .Situation like where we have to
find from so many things and trying to find that key will take long time and we
have to face some difficulties. Object classification is very important for
applications in automatic visual surveillance system. The process of classifying
objects into predefined and semantically meaningful categories using its
features is called object classification. In this paper we propose a new model for
detection and classification of objects by taking the features to classify the
detected objects using Deep Neural Network (DNN).
